# simonsosanimelist

Simonso's Anime List or SAL for short is a hobby project that I made to get better at programming (PHP), SQL (MySQL), html and css.
The app is based on my university's tech stack wich is the technology mentioned above.
Features include user registration, adding and removing data from the database and search for user.
